# Supabase Project Setup

This directory captures the configuration, migrations, and tooling required for the Vercel + Supabase migration.

## Prerequisites
- Supabase account with a Free or Pro project slot available.
- Supabase CLI `>=1.174.0` (`brew install supabase/tap/supabase` or download from https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
- Docker Desktop (for running the local Supabase stack via `supabase start`).
- Node.js 20.x (shared with the Next.js frontend) for executing migration scripts.

## Project Creation Checklist
1. Sign in to the Supabase dashboard and create a project named **Planning Tracker** (or reuse an existing sandbox).
2. Record the project reference (a short hash like `abcd1234`) and the generated Postgres password.
3. Invite the core team members (product owner, tech lead, developer accounts) with the **Developer** role.
4. Create the following API keys and note them for environment configuration:
   - `anon` public API key
   - `service_role` key (server-side only)
5. Enable email-based sign-in (magic links or password) under **Authentication â†’ Providers** and restrict redirect URLs to:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `https://<your-vercel-preview-domain>`
   - `https://<your-production-domain>`

## CLI Bootstrap
Initialise the local CLI project (runs once):

```bash
supabase init
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

After linking, you can run migrations and manage database schema with:

```bash
# Apply local migrations to the remote database
supabase db push

# Generate a new timestamped migration from SQL
supabase migration new name_of_change
```

The `supabase/config.toml` file (checked into the repo) stores the linked project reference for repeatable workflows.

## Local Development Stack
To run a local Postgres + Studio stack that mirrors Supabase:

```bash
supabase start
# Expose local connection details to the Next.js app
cp frontend/.env.supabase.example frontend/.env.local
vercel dev
```

This launches Postgres on `localhost:54322` with credentials saved under `.supabase`. Supabase Studio becomes available at `http://localhost:54323` for inspecting tables and auth.

## Environment Variables
Populate the following variables in Vercel/Supabase environments (see `frontend/.env.supabase.example`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (optional direct Postgres connection string for migrations/tests)
- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (available in Supabase project settings)
- `SUPABASE_DEFAULT_TEAM_ID` (UUID of the seed team record, defaults to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)

## Next Steps
Once the project is linked:
1. Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` to create the Postgres schema.
2. Run the data migration tooling in `scripts/supabase-migrate/` (added in later phases) to move DynamoDB data across.
3. Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel with the Supabase environment variables configured per environment (development, preview, production).
