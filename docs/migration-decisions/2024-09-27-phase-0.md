# Phase 0 â€“ Preparation Notes (2024-09-27)

## Business Sign-Off
- Product owner confirmed in the project Slack channel (#planning-tracker, message 2024-09-26 09:15) that migrating to Vercel + Supabase is approved, with a 1-hour maintenance window acceptable for the production cutover.
- No regulatory blockers identified; council stakeholders notified that authentication will switch to Supabase email links.

## Supabase Project
- Supabase Free Tier project earmarked for migration: placeholder reference `planning-tracker-dev` (actual ref to be updated once CLI link is executed).
- Team invitations: product owner, tech lead, developer accounts collected in `config/team-contacts.json` (redacted in repo; stored in 1Password).

## Tooling Installed
- Supabase CLI installation checklist added to `supabase/README.md` (requires brew install + Docker). Team members confirmed installation via #dev-infra thread on 2024-09-27.
- Vercel CLI already present globally; reinforced requirement to update to latest version prior to deployment phase.
- AWS CLI retained temporarily for DynamoDB export scripts.

## AWS Inventory Snapshot
- Consolidated inventory in `docs/archive/aws-sam/aws-inventory-2024-09.md` covering Amplify, API Gateway routes, Lambda functions, DynamoDB table/indexes, and Cognito configuration.
- All resource ARNs captured in the private infrastructure repository; summary sufficient for decommissioning tasks.

## Outstanding Prep Notes
- Docker Desktop must be kept running during local Supabase development.
- Need to request access for analytics contractor before production cutover (tracked in Jira PT-142).
